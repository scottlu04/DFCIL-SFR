## Offiical implementation for Data-Free Class Incremental Gesture Recognition via Synthetic Feature Sampling

Working in progress. 

THis repo contains the implementation of the method proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12629v1). 
Please refer to the [baseline branch](https://github.com/humansensinglab/dfcil-hgr/tree/baseline) for the other methods used for benchmarking.
